# Word Guessing Game
- Initialize a new game with a word to guess
    + initialize each game with a maximum wrong guess count based on length of the word
    + initialize each game with empty array of guessed letters
    + initialize each game with a string representing the state of the word to guess (e.g., would be initialized as '---' for a word that's 3 letters long)
    + initialize each game with boolean representing the state of the game (i.e., is the game over or not)
- Process letter guesses when entered
    + break process if letter has already been guessed
    + check if letter is included in the word
        * if yes - add letter to string representing the state of the word
        * if no - decrement the max wrong guess count
- Allow read access
