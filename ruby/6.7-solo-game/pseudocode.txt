# Word Guessing Game
- Initialize a new game with a word to guess
    + initialize each game with a maximum wrong guess count based on length of the word
    + initialize each game with empty array of guessed letters
    + initialize each game with a string representing the state of the word to guess (e.g., would be initialized as '---' for a word that's 3 letters long)
    + initialize each game with boolean representing the state of the game (i.e., is the game over or not)
- Process letter guesses when entered
    + break process if letter has already been guessed
    + check if letter is included in the word
        * if yes - add letter to string representing the state of the word
        * if no - increment the wrong guess counter
- Allow read access to string representing the state of the word to guess and boolean representing state of the game
- Determine game over message to send to user
    + if user has won - send congratulatory message including how many wrong guesses they used up
    + if user has lost - send taunting message revealing the word that they were unable to guess
