<!-- Release 4: Reflect
  1. The purpose of html semantic tags is to make your html content more human readable and to more clearly outline the content of your page. I see section, nav, header, and footer as the most useful due to how often I see them used on websites.
  2. The browser displays elements in the order you define them in your html code (i.e., reads from top to bottom in your html code). Note that block vs inline and CSS can affect how the browser displays elements.
  3. I learned how to create a snippet in Sublime, and I think that I will create more snippets in the future.
  4. I think creating the Sublime snippet was the most difficult as this was a concept that I had never been exposed to before. I could improve my understanding in this area by reading through some examples of snippets as well as making some more snippets on my own. -->
