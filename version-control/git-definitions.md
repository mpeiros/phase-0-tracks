# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - Version control is a system that tracks changes made to your code base. It is useful because it allows you to save your code before adding new features that could potentially break your current code. It also makes it easier for teams to collaborate on the same code base.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - A branch is basically a copy of your current code base that is used to add a new feature or update some code without disrupting the master branch (at least until the branch is approved/working and merged into the master branch).
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - A commit is basically a way of saving the changes you've made to your git repository. A good commit message should clearly state the changes that you are committing so that both you and your team can understand the commit and easily refer back to it if needed.
* What is a merge conflict?
    - A merge conflict occurs when different changes are made to the same line of a file on different branches and then these branches are attempted to be merged.
