# Plan to Learn jQuery

- Google jQuery to get an overview of the library
- Look through documentation either on official jQuery site or other resources
- Review example code provided with documentation or perhaps another resource
- Look up any quick jQuery tutorials or perhaps a tutorial for just a specific piece of jQuery
- A quick break every 30-45 minutes seems reasonable
- Testing will be somewhat of a judgment call depending on how well I grasp what I am learning

# Release 1

- Reading through the official jQuery site and its documentation was helpful
- Trying to watch a YouTube video tutorial on jQuery was not that helpful given the time constraints
- Reviewing jQuery examples on w3 was helpful for figuring out syntax to perform different functions
- Breaks were helpful in terms of refreshing my mind
- Ended up just reading for the most part and didn't do any testing on my own
